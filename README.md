# Directed Study on Computer Vision and Facial Recognition
Currently completing CSET 3840, a directed study class with a focus on Computer Vision and Facial Recognition. The goal of the course is to create a working Facial Recognition Demo to set up in the Emerging Tech Lab of the Wond'ry. I will also produce a context piece that will look into the ethics and implications of Facial Recognition.

## Progress
As of now, I am working on using a mini-course on using OpenCV and deep learning to produce a facial recognition demo.
